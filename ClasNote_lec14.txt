>> it is kind of what you'd expect.
>> ...(Compound interest) is a nice formula.
>> ... refuse to do sth if ... looks like sth (Pronoun) .

Pronouns are words that we use in place of Nouns (or other Pronouns) in a sentence
to make it less repetitive and less awkward.

a title and labeled axes.
>> It's easy enough to do.
>> ... that gives sb(me) a much more useful sth(graph).
>> Nothing magical here, it's just a reminder that ...(you really need to do these things(plural noun))
>> ...(You'll noticed here I've) not only do(told sb that this is the years of compounding and that this
is the principal) but ...(I've measured it in dollars)
>> I should have been (present perfect continuous) even ( more explicit(adj.) and said
>> One of the things I did want to point out is ....(you saw the two of these various icons that will
let you do things like zoom in on a graph and savve a graph)

present perfect continuous: is used to denote that something which had begun in the past is still continued.

Plural [ˈplo͝orəl]:

You can actually get rich applying it.
I usually refuse to look at it if it looks like this.
It's a floppy disk, in case you've never seen one. I brought a floppy disk to show you.
floppy disks: These were invented in 1971 by IBM
>> sth be invented in year(1971) by sb(IBM)
>> They were originally 8 inches in diameter and held all of kilobytes of data.

pioneer [ˌpīəˈnir]: a person who is among the first to explore or settle a new country or area.
>> Eventually, Apple and others pioneered a non-floppy floppy disk, that was in the '80s.
>> ...(USB) that holds roughly 400,000 times more data than this floppy.
>> It's just quite incredible how things have gone along. {事情的进展真是令人难以置信。}
... want to return to what will be the main theme[THēm] for, as I said, a couple weeks which is
randomness.
>> And in order to talk about ...(randomness) we have to talk about ...(probability)

deteriorated[dəˈtirēəˌrāt]: become progressively(steadily[ˈstedəlē]) worse.
>> your mind kind of deteriorated a little bit over spring break, and your head isn't quite into things.
And so, I'm just going to back up a tiny bit and start over to get our heads into it, and then fairly
quickly move on to new things.

*** Probabilities can never be more than 1 as we'll see.

>> let's now try and think of the right way to look at this question.

Q: How many possible 10-digit numbers are there?
A: 6^10 (6 to the 10th)

Q: What's the odds[ädz] of not getting 1 the first or the second time?
A: 5/6 * 5/6 (5 over 6 times 5 over 6) because these are independent events.(that's a key notion here)

notion: a conception of or belief about something.

>> I'm assuming that whether I get a 1 on the second roll is independent of whether I got a 1 on the first
roll.

dice die: throwing the dice
et cetera[et ˈsedərə]

The probability of not getting a 1 in 10 rolls : (5/6)^10 ((5 over 6) to the 10th)

>> That make sense?
>> If not, speak up, because things are going to get more complicated quickly.

Q: Are you all with me on that?

>> It was good effort.

** If you want to get something where everything is covered, the probabilities always have to sum to 1.
There are only two possibilities here, one possibility is I don't get any 1's. One possibility is I get
at least one 1.

If I take all of the possibilities, and I subtract the possibilities of not getting any 1's, the result
must be the probability of getting at least one 1.

>> This is a very common trick in sth(computing probabilities).

Q: What's the probability of x ?
A: The simplest way to compute it, is to compute the probability of not x and subtract it from 1.

>> heading down a wrong track for this, one might have said, .....

>> we know that can't be true. Because a probability always has to be less than or equal to 1.
This is a good trick to keep in mind, whenever you've given a probability problem, try and figure out
whether you have a good way to compute it directly, or whether it's simpler to compute the not of the
probability, and then subtract it from 1.

Probability is really fun field. It's interesting, it's history, it's intimately[ˈin(t)əmətlē] connected
with the history of gambling.

>> People of ...., all famous names you've heard, were motivated by desire to understand games of chance.

>> The date at least, {archaeologically[ˌärkēəˈläjək(ə)l]:the study of human history and prehistory through the
excavation[ˌekskəˈvāSH(ə)n] of sites and the analysis of artifacts and other physical remains.}, to about
600 BC, where a pair of dice was found in Egyptian tombs.

millennium [məˈlenēəm]: a period[ˈpirēəd] of a thousand years. plural millennia [məˈlenēə]
>> Two millennia before the birth of Christ, people found dice in Egyptian tombs.

Q: Is it profitable to do sth(to bet that given 24 rolls of a pair of fair dice, you would roll a double 6?

profitable: (of a business or activity) yielding profit or financial gain.
{Yield[yēld]: 1. produce or provide (a natural, agricultural[ˌaɡrəˈkəlCH(ə)rəl], or industrial product).
2.give way to arguments, demands, or pressure.}

Situation: He (actually) had a friend (who was in the business of gambling), making these bets[bet].

>> Double 6, what we call today "box cars", in those days they just called two 6's.
>> This was considered a (really) hard problem (in the mid-17th century).
>> In fact, Pascal and Fermat, (two pretty smart guys) as it happens, debated[dəˈbāt] this.
They exchanged sth(letter) with each other doing sth(trying to figure out)(how to solve this problem.)
>> It shows sth.(how math has advanced), because, in fact, today, it's quite an easy problem.

Q: What's the probability of not getting it 24 times(not getting a double 6) in a row?
A: (35/36)^24, which is approximately[əˈpräksəmətlē] equal to 0.51.

There is a slight edge in betting that you will not get a double 6 in 24 times.

>> As old as dice is, people have built cheater's dice.
The excavation of Pompeii, for example, they discovered a pair of loaded dice, dice with a little weight in it so
one number would come up more often that it should.

Quote: "Are you on unusually unlucky when it comes to rolling dice?"

>> for {amusement: noun. the state or experience of finding something funny.} only.
>> As much as I do sth(trust probability theory), I don't trust my ability to use it.
>> And so what I did is wrote a little simulation to see if sb(Pascal) was right (when he did this).
